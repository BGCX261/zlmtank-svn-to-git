0. Introduction.
**************** 

0.1 CL386, what can it do ?

CL386 is a  program -  shell for  compile,  assemble and link.  It  is
written specially for ‘‘386.EXE, but can be used with other programs.
CL386  works in MS-DOS, but  if you written system depend _splitpath()
and _makepath(), there are no obstacles for work under other OS.

0.2 CL386, what is it like ?

Analogs CL386 is: CL.EXE (Microsoft/VisualC/C++ ), BCC.EXE (Borland C/C++),
WCL.EXE (Watcom C/C++), SC.EXE (Symantec C/C++).


1. How CL386 works?
******************* 

1.1 What is need for CL386?

For CL386 are necessary next files: CC386.EXE, TASM.EXE and link :
TLINK.EXE or WLINK.EXE . Check (or add) path to these programs in 
environment variable PATH !

1.1 Algorithm of operation CL386.

1)  At first  parameters are  read.  The  parameters are  filename  or
option. Parameters you can set in: 
- configuration file CL386.CFG. If you rename CL386.EXE to <name>.EXE;
in the <name>.CFG file.  The search of the  configuration file  passes
in such sequence: in  the current directory, and  if not found -  that
in the directory, from which start CL386.EXE. 
- variable of environment CL386  . Add, for example,  in AUTOEXEC.BAT
SET CL386 =...  also don't worry about parameters by default...:)
- in command line. Also, file can with wildcards '*' and '?' !
2) Them generate files CC386.$$$, TASM.$$$ and LINK.$$$ for a response
in appropriate programs.
3) Are called CC386.EXE, TASM.EXE and TLINK.EXE (WLINK.EXE) before 
appearance of an error !!! 
4) If there  are no parameters  in command line  or the option  /?  is
found or not files, the brief help about options is output.

1.2 Remark.

- For  work with large  count of  files use option  '@filename' ,  and
place in  'filename'  the  list of  files and  options,  separated  by
blanks or character '\n'; 
- Use an option /K for review of files CC386.$$$, TASM.$$$ and LINK.$$$;
- Use an option /v for make the debug version of the program;
- Do not add an option /? in CL386.CFG or in environment variable CL386;
- Default .LST & .LSA disable, for enable use /l ;
- I output listing file .ASM with extention .LSA

1.3 Errorlevels.

Program return next exitcode :

	  0  - Ok
	128  - Fatal error ( "Out of memory", etc )
	129  - Problem with files ( open, write etc )
	
Also return errorlevel's CC386, TASM & TLINK(WLINK) !

2. Option CL386.
***************

/i      - produce the file after the preprocessor,
    there can be /i+ or /i-, /i that, as /i+;
/l      - produce .LST the file, 
    there can be /l+ or /l-, /l that,as /l+;
/e      - produce .ERR the file, 
    there can be /e+ or /e-, /e that,as /e+;
/A      - enable ANSI compatibility, 
    there can be /A+ or /A-, /A that, as /A+;
/w-xxx  - disable warnings, look documentation on CC386.EXE;
/Cxxx   - option for generation of the code,
    look documentation on CC386.EXE;
/Dxxx   - define symbol for the preprocessor,
    look documentation on CC386.EXE;
/Enn    - define max count of errors for CC386;
/Ipath  - set path to included files;
/Oxxx   - option for optimization, look documentation on CC386.EXE;
@name   - define the file with parameters for response;
/K      - not delete files CC386.$$$, TASM.$$$ and LINK.$$$;
    there can be /K+ or /K-, /K that, as /K+;
/Lxxx   - set path to files .LIB and .OBJ;
/a      - generate only .ASM files;
/c      - generate only .OBJ files;
/v      - full the debugging information and debug version;
/m      - generate .MAP the file;
/n      - not link files by default;
/k      - not delete files *.ASM & *.OBJ;
    there can be /k+ or /k-, /k that, as /k+;
/Tp     - use for link TLINK with PMODE
/Tl     - use for link TLINK with PMODE, 
    startup module NOT copy to DPMI mem
/Tw     - use for link WLINK with PMODE/W
/Td     - use for link WLINK with stub D4GWSTUB ( call DOS/4GW )
/Rname  - set name to .EXE file
/?,/h,/H - help.

A.0 Tips for using TASM v4.1 for DOS !!!

Don't use TASM v4.1 !!! For example compile with TASM v4.1 :

============================================= 1.ASM
        .model tiny
        .code
        .386
start:
        rept 1024
        local hi
        jc hi
hi:
        endm
        end start
=============================================

	tasm /m2 1.ASM
	tlink /3/c/t 1.OBJ

and see in disassembler code in 1.COM :(
